## ðŸ—‚ Data & API Simulation

- **MSW/MirageJS** simulates REST APIs with artificial latency (200â€“1200ms) & error rate (5â€“10%)  
- Persistence via **IndexedDB (Dexie)**  
- On refresh, state restores from IndexedDB  

**Endpoints simulated:**
- `GET /jobs`, `POST /jobs`, `PATCH /jobs/:id`, `PATCH /jobs/:id/reorder`  
- `GET /candidates`, `POST /candidates`, `PATCH /candidates/:id`  
- `GET /candidates/:id/timeline`  
- `GET /assessments/:jobId`, `PUT /assessments/:jobId`, `POST /assessments/:jobId/submit`

---

## ðŸ“¦ Seed Data
- **25 jobs** (active, archived, draft, paused)  
- **1000 candidates** randomly assigned to jobs & stages  
- **3+ assessments** with 10+ questions each
